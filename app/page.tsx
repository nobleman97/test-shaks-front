          <p className="mb-[45px]">SMM for small businesses can be hard. Therefore, our team has worked closely with many entrepreneurs to show them how it works. For some, you may experience some learning gaps from traditional thinking and marketing. At Shakazu, your marketing goals are our goals. Our role as a social media management company is to help you understand and utilize social media marketing so that your business profits from it!</p>

          <h3 className=" text-[#FB6300] text-base font-semibold mb-[15px]">Why do you need a SMM company?</h3>

          <p className="">There are almost 4 billion people on social media, and that number continues to grow every year. This means that regardless of what industry your company is in, your customers are using social media on a daily basis. It is important that you keep them engaged and connected to your brand so that you&apos;re always their first option. Similarly, if your company is offering a beneficial product or service, then there are people searching for it.</p>

          <p className="mb-[70px]">The key to creating a successful social media management campaign (or any digital marketing campaign for that matter!) is the ability to lower your CPA (cost per acquisition) and maximize your ROI (return on investment). The reason we help so many businesses with their social media marketing is because social media provides them the avenue to do just this.</p>
