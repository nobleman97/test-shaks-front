                <h3>Social Media At a Glance.</h3>

                <p>Social media has taken the world by storm since its original creation. The amount of social media users has risen up to over 4 billion (which will be double what it was in 2015!). On average, people have at least 8 different social media accounts- and they don&apos;t just have them, they&apos;re using them! Big platforms like Facebook saw well over half of their monthly users using Facebook daily in some of the latest data. The volume of people using social media, however, is not the only thing that&apos;s changed.</p>

                <p>The way people use social media has changed as well! It was originally created as a way for friends and family to communicate and socialize online, but it has become so much more than that. In today&apos;s world, yes the main use remains to be interacting with friends and family, but it&apos;s also an opportunity for brands and consumers or leads to connect. Listen to these recent statistics. 71% of consumers who had a positive social media experience with a brand were likely to recommend it to other people, and 21% of consumers are more likely to buy from brands that they can reach on social media. Social media platforms have started doubling as ecommerce platforms and/or as a major step in your marketing funnel for building connections.</p>

                <p>So if you&apos;re new to social media, what you need to understand as a business owner is that at its core social media is a place for people to connect with friends, family and brands alike. And as it continues to grow at an explosive rate you&apos;ll want to take advantage of it for your business. That&apos;s where social media marketing services come in.</p>
